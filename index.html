            Hello, my name is Chelsea Romo and you are on my first webpage! Sorry if this is bad, every time I try to work with coding I want to cry. I apparently graduated from child to adult at UIC studying History and Theatre Design, Production, and Technology. This is a website for my IDEA 120 class. Right now my CSS Stylesheet does not really want to work with me so here I am.

        <h1> <center>Project 1: Header</center>
        </h1>
   <br>
   <div>
    <img src="images/chelsea_idea_120_homework_uic_update.png"
    height="" width="100%" border="1px"></p>
    <p><center>This is the first thing I worked on for IDEA 120. It was originally supposed to be a header, but this coding thing is too hard for me to figure that out. I went with the theme of space as I wanted to be an astronaut but I am too short and too sad to join as so I am just making space themed stuff. </p>

    <h1><center> Project 2: Fonts</center>
    </h1>
    <p ><img src="images/header.png"
      height="" width="100%" border="1px"></p>
    <p><center>
        For this project, we had to alter the fonts of our headers. However, I really liked my header font, so I just added my last name around the blue circle and connected the L and the S. The reason I removed the stars is just because I wanted to clean up the logo and the stars were too hard to make.</center></p>

       height="" width="100%" border="1px" class="center">
     </p>
    <p><center>
    This is my take of the video game project that we had for this class. I wanted to make a dating sim originally but I realized that is too much work for a first game and so I made a simulator of bathing my dog, Zucco.</center>
